# MIND-MAP-APP
 Simple and intuitive app for mind mapping using p5.js library.

I love mindmapping and use it everyday.
Heard of it? If not, you really should to know mind maps better!
This is very powerfull tool for your mind.
You can use it while studying, learning, creating, planning, reading etc.

The basic idea of mind maps is to distract keywords from the information you are reading or listening and put them into mind map.

In the middle of your mindmap the core keyword should be.
It can be not only one word. That can be a topic, a full sentence etc.

You put keywords around the Core Keyword and connect them with the core with lines.

Every Keyword can initiate a new branch/ topic and become a Core Keyword for other keyword, which will be related with this particular keyword.

So you see, that you are building a structure of related keywords.

Usually I do mindmapping on a paper and prefer this method.
I've tried a few apps for mindmapping, but wasn't satisfied...
So I decided to build my own app :-)

Also this is a good opportunity for me to get back to (and recall) p5.js library.

I hope you'll enjoy it!

PS. if you want to save your mind map, just press mouse right button and Save an image. Thats' all! Now you can share it, put it in your presentation or print.
