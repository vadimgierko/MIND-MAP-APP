ABOUT APP:

(Note: this branch is dedicated to integration of this app with firebase currently - the process is on, so if you want to see the source code of app that you see in github pages, which is saving your mindmaps in local storage, check out the new-1-navabar-bigger-canvas-version branch)

Mind Maps App is a very simple, intuitive and easy to use application for online mindmapping.

This app allows you to put keywords in any place (not like in other mindmapping apps), what means that you are totally free and not limited by a default structure!

And... you can save the mind map you've created as a PNG image thanks to only one click on canvas (check out the tutorial)! That means, that you can put in your presentation, blog post or any document, or print it.

MOTIVATION:

I love mindmapping and use it everyday.

Usually I do mindmapping on a paper and prefer this method.
I've tried a few apps for mindmapping, but wasn't satisfied...
So I decided to build my own app :-)

Mind maps are very powerfull tool for your mind.
You can use it while studying, learning, creating, planning, reading etc and do that thing much better and get better results with mind maps.

The basic idea of mind maps is to distract keywords from the information you are reading or listening and put them into mind map.

In the center there is the core keyword (the main topic of your mind map). You put keywords around the Core Keyword and automatically connect them with lines.

Every Keyword can initiate a new branch/ topic and become a Core Keyword for other keyword, which will be related with this particular keyword.

So you see, that you are building a structure of related keywords.

TECHNOLOGIES:

- JavaScript
- p5.js library (no HTML Canvas was used)
- Bootstrap (pure)
